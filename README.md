VeraFlick
=========

This is the IOS app I created to remote into a micasaverde home automation controller.  My goal was to create an application that is easy and also fun to use.  The application is built for IOS 6 and above, currently only iPhone support. I have not built a design that supports the iPad yet, but people are welcome to contribute.

Currently supports:
- Login to micasaverde controller (from internal or external network)
- Sorts devices by room.
- Currenlty supports only dimmer switches and regular switches
- Adds support for users to define their own room images (and comes with some stock ones)
